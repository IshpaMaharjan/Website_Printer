        <p class="text">First image is our home page and Second image is referenced page. <br>
            If you compare the first and second figure you can see that navigation bar and logo location are similar to
            each other. <br>
            Extra printer image was added below logo with some text to make it unique, Creative logo was assigned at
            logo location, extra search bar
            is at top right corner of home page, Idea was taken but not copied. This home page was made in own style. <br>
            The link to crazy egg website is https://www.crazyegg.com/ . <br>
            <span class="dots">...</span>
            <!-- Making class for js use -->
            <span class="moreText"> Product page was referenced from HP Printers obviously
                for research purpose.By comparing third and fourth image , you can see that slider is excluded for different design,
                rating added and prices are added to make it convenient. <br>
                Third image is our group and Fourth image
                is researched.The link to hp website is https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/cat/printers . <br>
                Fifth image is our about us page and sixth image is referenced image. <br>
                If we compare both images putting images in start of image was done to make styling better and putting
                images of website developer to give credits was unique, Instead of
                taking email feedback form was put to make it different. <br>
                The link of epson website is
                https://epson.com/about-us . <br>
                Seventh image is our research page and Eighth image is
                referenced page. <br>
                By comparing seventh and eighth image we can see that images are compared in both
                pages, Text and images are put in seperate places for change in style. <br>
                The link to amazon website is https://www.amazon.in/Printers/b?ie=UTF8&node=1375 . <br>
                Ninth and Tenth image is our blog page and referenced page. <br>
                In our blog page we made seperate boxes for details with similar way of arranging images beside information,
                Find out more javascript was not added to add uniqueness.The link to pixartprinting is https://www.pixartprinting.com/ . <br>
